	 Project definition for group 07


Your project is to develop the code for an arbitrator.
Your arbitrator will support 7 masters

The masters will make a request with a signal 'need'
The masters own the bus when they receive a signal 'ack'


Masters can also be a slave. A master may target itself.
 Master	 Master		Master
 Number	 Slave		Slave
       	 Addr 		Addr
       	 Start		End

   0	fffe7637	fffe7643
   1	ffffd325	ffffd382
   2	ffff109e	ffff115f
   3	ffff428c	ffff438a
   4	fffef204	fffef295
   5	fffe740c	fffe74b1
   6	fffead20	fffead52

The master address bus is 64 bits wide, and named 'addrM64'
The master data out bus is called 'DoutM'
The master data in bus is called 'MinData'
Each master shall be arbitrated so it receives at least
the following arbitration percentages:
Master Percent 

  4   	25
  3   	19
  6   	16
  0  	15
  1   	13
  5   	 6
  2   	 6
The percentages shall be computed over intervals of 500 cycles
All percentage usages start over on each interval

The slave data bus into the slave is 64 bits wide, and named 'SbusIn'
The slave data bus out from the slave is named 'dbus_out'

 The slave address bus is 64 bits wide, and named 'addr'
Each slave has an enable called 'en' indicating a valid cycle has begun
Each slave indicates the end of transfer with a signal called 'Tdone'
Each cycle after en up to and including Tdone is assumed to transfer data

slave	Addr L		Addr H

 0	ffff37c8	ffff38a2
 1	ffffd9bc	ffffda14
 2	ffffad86	ffffadc9
 3	ffffa294	ffffa345
 4	fffff7e5	fffff89a
 5	ffff5e9e	ffff5f50
 6	ffffb7b4	ffffb8a8
 7	ffff4a19	ffff4b0d

The clock is named 'sysClk' and is active on the negedge
The system reset is named 'Breset'
